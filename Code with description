Viewing Video with PiCamera
Let’s get started. Here is a simple program from the PiCamera documentation to view the camera feed:
from picamera import PiCamera

from time import sleep




camera = PiCamera()

camera.start_preview()

sleep(20)

camera.stop_preview()
This will display the camera on the video screen for 20 seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create the file:
    • Use the text editor nano, “nano camera.py”
    • Copy and paste the program into the text file:
    
    from picamera import PiCamera
    from time import sleep
    camera = PiCamera()
    camera.start_preview()
    sleep(20)
    camera.stop_preview()

    • “Ctrl-x”, “y” and then “enter” to save the file as “py”
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    To run it:
    • Type in, “chmod 777 camera.py” to make it executable
    • Then, “python3 ./camera.py”
And that is it! The video display should show the camera feed.

Recording Video with PiCamera
Here is a simple program to record a feed, a simple date time stamp has been added:
import datetime

import time

date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S")

import picamera

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:

camera.start_preview()

camera.start_recording("/home/pi/"+ date + "video.h264")

camera.wait_recording(30)

camera.stop_recording()

camera.stop_preview()

This will display the camera on the monitor for 30 seconds, and record it to a file called “video.h264”, with a date/ time 
stamp, in your “/home/pi/” folder. Simply save the file as “record.py”, make it executable, and then run it as we did the 
previous program.

Remote Streaming with PiCamera
Viewing the camera directly is nice, but for a surveillance camera, we need to be able to access it remotely. The PiCamera Documentation Webpage includes a script for accessing PiCamera from a remote system. The script is located here, just save it as a .py file, make it an executable file and run it.

Now on a remote system on your network, open a browser and surf to:
[Your_IP_Address]:8000
And you should see the feed from your camera or device.
