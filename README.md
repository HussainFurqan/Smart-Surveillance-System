# Smart-Surveillance-System

Closed-circuit television monitoring system has now be- come an indispensable device in todayâ€™s society Supermarkets, 
factories, hospitals, hotels, schools, and companies are having their own CCTV system for 24/7 monitoring. 
Instead of using the traditional wireless CCTV surveillance cameras, customers can now own their inexpensive security 
systems with the tiny super computer called Raspberry Pi IP cameras can serve better as they can send and receive data 
via computer network and internet based on internet protocol. Also resolution clarity of IP cameras is far better than 
CCTV cameras. A camera module connected to the Raspberry Pi will records all the happenings in the monitored area and 
live streaming can be viewed from any web browser, even from mobile in real-time.
There are many problems in the video surveillance system, such as: picture is indistinct, anomalies cannot be identified 
automatically and a lot of storage spaces are needed to save the surveillance information. Moreover, in recent years, Motion 
Detection [4], [5] has attracted a great interest from computer vision researchers due to its promising applications in 
many areas, such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring or sign language recognition. To overcome storage spaces issue, 
we apply the Motion Detection algorithm for live camera streaming, this allows the system to analyze incoming images from 
cameras, and recognize when movement occurs. And then, the video system can collect and store the most importance items for 
the administrators review.
